## ‚öôÔ∏è Next Steps

### 1. Configure Git and GitHub

After the main setup, run the dedicated Git setup script. This will guide you through configuring your Git identity and setting up an SSH key to connect to GitHub.

```bash
./setup_git_github.sh
```

### 2. Customize Starship

The `gruvbox-rainbow` preset is installed by default. You can customize it by editing `~/.config/starship.toml`. To find more themes, visit the [Starship Presets website](https://starship.rs/presets/).

To apply a new preset:
```bash
# Example: Apply the 'pastel-powerline' preset
starship preset pastel-powerline -o ~/.config/starship.toml

# Fix the time format to 12-hour (optional)
./fix_starship_time.sh

# Restart the shell to see changes
exec zsh
```
